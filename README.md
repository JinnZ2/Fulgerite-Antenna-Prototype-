# Fulgurite Antenna Prototype

## Overview
This project explores **fulgurite-inspired antenna geometries** for radio frequency (RF) reception and energy harvesting.  
Fulgurites are naturally occurring glass-like fractals formed when lightning strikes sand or soil. Their branching, self-similar channels offer unique **fractal discharge geometries** that may provide **broadband resonance** and **nonlinear coupling advantages** for antenna design.

Our goal is to:
- Translate fulgurite discharge fractals into **functional antenna prototypes**.
- Test reception and spectral response against **RTL-SDR satellite signals** and other RF sources.
- Compare performance across different materials (copper wire, conductive composites, possible sintered glass/metal hybrids).

## Prototype Approach

1. **Geometry Extraction**
   - Base structure: Lichtenberg / fractal tree patterns.
   - Iterative branching defined by:
     - Angle distribution: ~30â€“40Â° random variance.
     - Branch length scaling: `L(n+1) = L(n) * r` where `r â‰ˆ 0.6â€“0.7`.
     - Self-similar recursion until branch < cutoff length.

2. **Materials**
   - Phase 1: Copper wire bent into fractal geometry.
   - Phase 2: Alternative conductors (aluminum, conductive carbon, silver plating).
   - Phase 3: Hybrid fulgurite molds (sand/glass fused with metal inserts).

3. **Testing Setup**
   - SDR: RTL-SDR dongle with GNU Radio / SDR++.
   - Frequency range: 137 MHz (NOAA APT), 162 MHz (weather), 400â€“1600 MHz (broadband test).
   - Compare against baseline dipole antenna.

4. **Simulation & Equations**
   - Fractal resonance approximated by:
     - `f0 = c / (2 * L_eff)` where `L_eff` is total unfolded branch length.
   - Multi-band behavior emerges from branch-length distribution.
